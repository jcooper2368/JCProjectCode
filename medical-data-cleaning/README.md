# Investigating Causes of Patient Readmissions Across Different States

## Overview
This project investigates the factors causing patient readmissions in different states within the country. By analyzing a detailed dataset with various patient-related variables, the goal is to identify significant predictors of readmissions and support hospitals in developing strategies to minimize readmission rates, enhance patient care, and optimize resource allocation.

## Research Question
What causes readmissions for patients in certain states of the country?

## Objectives
- To analyze the factors that contribute to patient readmissions in different states.
- To clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure quality data for analysis.
- To provide recommendations based on the analysis to help hospitals reduce readmission rates and improve patient management.

# Data, Scripts, and Reports
Data: The dataset includes 50 variables related to patient demographics, health conditions, and hospital visit details. The raw dataset is no longer available, but the Jupyter notebook provides an overview of the data cleaning process.

[Medical Data Notebook](Medical%20Data.ipynb): Contains the entire data cleaning and analysis process, including data transformation, imputation, and statistical tests.

[Report](https://github.com/jcooper2368/JCProjectCode/raw/main/medical-data-cleaning/Data%20Cleaning%20Part%201.pdf): Includes the code and outputs of the analysis, along with detailed findings and recommendations.
