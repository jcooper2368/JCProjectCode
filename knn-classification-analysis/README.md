# Predictive Customer Churn Analysis with K-Nearest Neighbors

## Overview
This project focused on predicting customer churn using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification technique. The analysis identifies significant variables that influence churn, providing telecommunication companies with valuable insights to refine their retention strategies.

[Cleaned Data](https://github.com/jcooper2368/JCProjectCode/raw/main/knn-classification-analysis/new_cleaned_data_two.csv): The data source was used to analyze customer behaviors and predict churn based on various factors.

[Churn Clean Data Notebook](Churn%20Clean%20Data.ipynb): Contains the Python code used for data cleaning, preprocessing, feature selection, and building the KNN model to predict customer churn.

[Classification Analysis Report](https://github.com/jcooper2368/JCProjectCode/raw/main/knn-classification-analysis/Classification%20Analysis.pdf): Detailed analysis using the KNN classification technique to predict customer churn, including methodology, data preparation, and model evaluation.
