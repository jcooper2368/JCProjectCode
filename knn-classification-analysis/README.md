# Predictive Customer Churn Analysis with K-Nearest Neighbors

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on predicting customer churn using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification technique. The analysis identifies significant variables that influence churn, providing telecommunication companies with valuable insights to refine their retention strategies.

## Data
The original data sources were used to analyze customer behaviors and predict churn based on various factors.

## Python Notebook
Contains the Python code used for data cleaning, preprocessing, feature selection, and building the KNN model to predict customer churn.

## Report
Detailed analysis using the KNN classification technique to predict customer churn, including methodology, data preparation, and model evaluation.
