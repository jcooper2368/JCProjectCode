# Customer Segmentation and Lifetime Value Prediction in a Jewelry Store

## Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior and predicting the lifetime value of each segment. Using Hierarchical Clustering and predictive modeling, the analysis provides actionable insights for targeted marketing, inventory management, and improving overall operational efficiency in a jewelry store.

## Objectives
- To analyze customer purchasing behaviors and segment customers using Hierarchical Clustering.
- To predict customer lifetime value (CLV) for each segment to enhance marketing and inventory strategies.
- To provide actionable recommendations for product development, inventory management, and seasonal marketing.
