# Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks 

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Project. This project aims to analyze Yelp reviews to understand how specific aspects of customer service, such as friendliness, service speed, cleanliness, and product quality, impact overall sentiment towards a business. By using sentiment analysis, I classify reviews into positive negative, or neutral categories and examine how these aspects correlate with customer sentiment. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model is employed for this text classification task, utilizing tokenization, text normalization, and word embeddings to process the reviews. The outcome will provide actionable insights to help businesses improve their customer service in key areas that influence satisfaction. 

## Project Organization 

[Sentiment Analysis Data](https://github.com/jcooper2368/JCProjectCode/raw/main/sentiment-analysis-neural-networks/yelp_labelled.txt): The Yelp labeled data with customer reviews. 

Disclaimer: The original dataset file was unfortunately lost after project development. However, I located a similar file online that appears to closely match the original dataset used for this project. While every effort has been made to ensure the new dataset aligns with the original in structure and content, there may be minor discrepancies. These differences are not expected to significantly affect the overall analysis, but they are noted for transparency.



[Supplemental Predictive Maintenance Dataset](https://github.com/jcooper2368/JCProjectCode/raw/main/predictive-tool-maintenance/Supplemental%20Predictive%20Maintenance%20Dataset.xlsx): A supplemental dataset created by extending the UCI AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset with simulated data for demand per tool usage, parts per tool, lead times, inventory levels, and reorder points.
