# Sentiment Analysis Using Neural Networks 

Welcome to the Sentiment Analysis Project. This project aims to analyze Yelp reviews to understand how specific aspects of customer service, such as friendliness, service speed, cleanliness, and product quality, impact overall sentiment towards a business. By using sentiment analysis, I classify reviews into positive negative, or neutral categories and examine how these aspects correlate with customer sentiment. A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model is employed for this text classification task, utilizing tokenization, text normalization, and word embeddings to process the reviews. The outcome will provide actionable insights to help businesses improve their customer service in key areas that influence satisfaction. 

## Project Organization 

[UCI Machine Learning Dataset](https://github.com/jcooper2368/JCProjectCode/raw/main/predictive-tool-maintenance/ai4i2020_pmd.csv): The AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository provides historical tool usage data, performance metrics, and operational demands reflecting real-world predictive maintenance scenarios. 

[Supplemental Predictive Maintenance Dataset](https://github.com/jcooper2368/JCProjectCode/raw/main/predictive-tool-maintenance/Supplemental%20Predictive%20Maintenance%20Dataset.xlsx): A supplemental dataset created by extending the UCI AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset with simulated data for demand per tool usage, parts per tool, lead times, inventory levels, and reorder points. 

[Tool Failure Analysis](https://github.com/jcooper2368/JCProjectCode/raw/main/predictive-tool-maintenance/Tool%20Failure%20Analysis%20(2).ipynb): Explore the Python scripts and Jupyter notebook used for data preprocessing, analysis, and predictive modeling. Review the predictive machine learning models developed to forecast tooling failures based on historical data.
