# Analyzing the Impact of Initial Hospital Stay Duration on Readmission Rates

## Overview
This project investigates whether there is a statistically significant difference between the mean duration of initial hospital stays and the likelihood of patient readmission within a month. By leveraging a data-driven approach, hospitals can better understand this relationship and develop strategies to reduce readmission rates, ultimately enhancing healthcare quality and efficiency.
