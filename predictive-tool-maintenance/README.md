# Predictive Tool Maintenance Project

Welcome to the Predictive Tool Maintenance Project, a part of my capstone portfolio. This project focuses on utilizing data analytics and machine learning techniques to forecast tool failures, optimize inventory reorder points, and enhance capacity planning in a test work center. Below is an outline of the project's structure and resources. 

## Project Organization 

Data Sources: Access the dataset used in this project.
