# Predictive Tool Maintenance Project

Welcome to the Predictive Tool Maintenance Project, a part of my capstone portfolio. This project focuses on utilizing data analytics and machine learning techniques to forecast tool failures, optimize inventory reorder points, and enhance capacity planning in a test work center. Below is an outline of the project's structure and resources. 

## Project Organization 

Data Sources: Access the dataset used in this project. 

[UCI Machine Learning Dataset](https://github.com/jcooper2368/JCProjectCode/raw/main/predictive-tool-maintenance/ai4i2020_pmd.csv): The AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository provides historical tool usage data, performance metrics, and operational demands reflecting real-world predictive maintenance scenarios. 

[Supplemental Predictive Maintenance Dataset](https://github.com/jcooper2368/JCProjectCode/raw/main/predictive-tool-maintenance/Supplemental%20Predictive%20Maintenance%20Dataset.xlsx): A supplemental dataset created by extending the UCI AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset with simulated data for demand per tool usage, parts per tool, lead times, inventory levels, and reorder points.
