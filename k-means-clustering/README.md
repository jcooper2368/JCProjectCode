# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

## Project Overview
This project leverages K-Means clustering to segment customers based on income, email engagement, and tenure. The analysis identifies distinct groups to enable targeted marketing strategies that enhance customer satisfaction and drive business performance.

## Repository Contents
[Churn Clean Dataset](https://github.com/jcooper2368/JCProjectCode/raw/main/k-means-clustering/churn_clean_pres.csv): Cleaned and preprocessed dataset for analysis.

[Churn K-means Clustering Notebook](Churn%20K-means%20Clustering%20%282%29.ipynb): End-to-end implementation of K-Means clustering, including data exploration, scaling, clustering, and visualization.

[Clustering Techniques PDF](https://github.com/jcooper2368/JCProjectCode/raw/main/k-means-clustering/Clustering%20Techniques.pdf): Detailed findings, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the clustering results.

## Key Highlights
Techniques Used: Data preprocessing (scaling), optimal cluster selection using the elbow method, and visualizations.

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and SciPy.

Outcome: Identification of actionable customer segments for targeted marketing.
