## Telecom Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction
Overview
This project investigates the factors influencing customer churn in the telecommunications sector. The primary goal is to understand how various customer-related factors impact their decision to leave the service provider, and to develop predictive models that can help in formulating strategies to reduce churn rates.

Research Question
What is the impact of customer outages, equipment failure, amount of customer data used, customer geographical location, monthly charge, tenure, number of times the customer contacts technical support, payment methods, and area type on predicting customer churn?

Objectives
To analyze the influence of different customer-related factors on churn.

To develop logistic regression models to predict customer churn.

To provide recommendations to telecommunications companies to improve customer retention.
