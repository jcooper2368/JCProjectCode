# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

# Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry by examining a variety of factors including customer outages, equipment failure, amount of data used, geographical location, monthly charge, tenure, frequency of technical support interactions, payment methods, and area type. Utilizing logistic regression, the analysis seeks to uncover the impact of these factors on customer churn and provide actionable recommendations to telecommunications companies to enhance customer retention strategies.

## Objectives
- To analyze the influence of different customer-related factors on churn.
- To develop logistic regression models to predict customer churn.
- To provide recommendations to telecommunications companies to improve customer retention.
