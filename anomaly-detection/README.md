# Anomaly Detection for Fraud Prevention in Financial Transactions

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an anomaly detection model to identify potential fraud in financial transactions. Given the initially low fraud detection rate in the dataset, the aim is to refine the fraud detection process using both unsupervised and supervised learning techniques. This will help build a more robust model for identifying irregularities and improving the overall accuracy of fraud detection.

## Data, Scripts, and Reports
[PaySim Financial Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QrwKAn4UmmJ0KKVBj-C6G4Gh64GOPB1m/view?usp=drive_link): The transaction data includes features such as step (1 step = 1 hour), payment type, transaction amount, customer balances, and recipient balances.

[Fraud Detection Report](https://github.com/jcooper2368/JCProjectCode/raw/main/anomaly-detection/Fraud%20Detection%20-%20Project%202.docx): Includes the methodology, analysis, findings, and recommendations.
