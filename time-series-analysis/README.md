# Time Series Modeling 

This project analyzes daily revenue data from the first two years of a telecommunications company's operations. Leveraging time series modeling techniques, the analysis identifies key revenue trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies. The project utilizes models such as ARIMA to forecast future revenue, providing actionable insights for strategic planning.
